Many people are familiar with the old "Sorry, we are looking for someone with more experience" line when looking for a new job. For a freshly minted college graduate you will likely run into this MUCH more than you might anticipate. While I was in college 
I heard all the time about how there is a shortage of developers out here in the real world and that I am almost guaranteed a job! The fact is that's only partly true. 

My situation is a  little different than most. While I was college I participated in a co-op program where I would alternate between semesters at school and semesters working. The catch here is that you are going to typically be in college about a year or
so longer than your incoming peers. So whether you want to participate in a similar program is up to what you are looking to accomplish. Either graduating on time/early  or gain experience in the field you are going to move into. Now to me it seemed like a 
no brainer! The co-op program seemed great, not only would I get valuable work experience, I would get a chance to see if this is really a field I wanted to move into for the rest of my career. I also needed to work in order to afford housing, food, bills, etc.
so since the co-op program was a paid position, it was a win-win right? Well sort-of. The problem that I ran into was that the position I ended up accepting turned out to be for something that had little to nothing to do with what I was getting my degree in!
The experience and knowledge I gained was absolutely valuable but at the time I just couldn't see it.

When I was nearly done with college, I decided to transfer to a school closer to home. Before I moved back I spent a few months looking for jobs as a software developer. I know that I hadn't graduated yet and technically the job I was doing was not software
development but I had the experience from class and the learning I had done on my own. All I kept hearing was the ol' not enough experience line. I must have gone to 6-7 face-to-face interviews (these are usually the 2nd or 3rd level of interviewing) and would get the
same line. I decided then to make a pretty critical decision in my job search. I decided to look for jobs as an IT technician since this was what my co-op experience was in and then work my way up from there. I applied to a job posted by a recruiting agency
and within 2 weeks I was accepting a job offer to work at a fortune 100 company. How crazy is that! 

After starting my job, my main focus was to get hired by the company at the end of my contract period. I worked very hard and continued to attend classes at night at the end of the contract the company hired me directly. I was in! I spent the next 2 years moving up throughout the 
organization until I landed a job as a software developer. The most ironic thing is that I still hadn't finished my degree yet. I was able to show my peers and managers that I was capable of performing the job of a software developer without having completed my college degree. 
Since then I have complete my degree and worked on gaining my knowledge in several different programming languages, platforms, frameworks, tools and processes.

The point on telling my story is to tell others that there will be times when you may not be able to secure a job doing exactly what you think you want to do. When you first get out of college you might not be able to get that developer role you are so desperately searching 
for but you just might be able to apply the skills you have learned to another area of IT and then use those skills to get a foot in the door. That's all you need is that little sliver of a hole and once your in you can prove to everyone else just how good you really are!
