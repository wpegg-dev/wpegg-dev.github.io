Hey everyone! My name is William. I've been a software developer for the last three years and in the IT field for since 2008. I married to the most patient, amazing and beautiful woman in the world and we have three crazy dogs. I love software development. My wife might not always agree with the previous statement because things can get hard from time to time. Software development can be a very difficult profession and if you are not all in then it only makes it more difficult.

My goal for this blog is two-part. My main focus is to help other developers who are going through the same experiences as I have. Sometimes as a developer we run into experiences we are unprepared for and I hope by creating this blog other developers will be able to have a plan for whatever may come their way. The second part to the goal of this blog is to help keep me accountable by encouraging me to work on projects and learn new ideas, technology, processes, etc. in the software development field as a way to help master the craft I love.
