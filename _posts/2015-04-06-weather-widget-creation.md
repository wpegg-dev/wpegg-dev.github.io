I have bee really itching to get my Raspberry Pi running something on Ruby and thought this would be something really simple to turn into a small web app 
install Rails on my Raspberry Pi.

Then I decided to start working on how to get the Pen to work with some actual Ruby code. I made a small project on my machine by downloading the Aptana 
Studio 3 installer. After downloading and installing RubyInstaller I was ready to start coding! I did some looking online for Ruby gems that can be used for 
weather information and found one called forecast_io which corresponds to a website forecast.io. I checked it out and you can create a free account to use 

commands to create projects and modules and views using this tutorial, I had the widget working locally.

Next, I uploaded it onto the Raspberry Pi without any problems and it has been working great! I am going to work on getting Rails to start automatically when 
the server boots up and then to load the site to fit the full screen on the PiTFT I installed last week!

This was a really cool little project to take my mind of just learning Ruby and putting it to action and it was super fun! I think I might start looking into
doing more of these little projects to help learn the language and framework though doing.
